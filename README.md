# Assemble Midnight CTF

This event was run at the first midnight of Assemble on Saturday.

## Post Mortem

- lack of prep
- lack of collaboration
- unexpected issues (phone number)
- lack of communication with participants
- mass confusion
- final clue being found first

This event was, for the most part, a complete failure. I think there were several reasons for this, but the main one was that there were simply too many people in too big of a space working on the puzzle at once. This resulted in a situation where no one knew what was going on and small isolated teams formed such that each team lacked context and clues known by the other teams. Thus, most of the puzzles were unsolvable and we ended up aborting the event by just pasting mosting of the flags from secret flags file.

The confusion and lack of collaboration within the event was compounded by the rough beginning of the event, as the final production deployment of the site didn't build and hit the heroku server until after the event started, meaning it was in development mode for the first few minutes so most people never even saw the intro letter.

## The Puzzles

**NOTE: a few additional clues were added to the drives (along with other physical clues) before the event began that are not reflected in this repo. Unfortunately, these are probably lost to time.**

Thanks to Sam Poder, Ganning Xu, Khaleel Gibran, and everyone else who helped complete these puzzles.
