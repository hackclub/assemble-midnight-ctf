6*19*34*44*80*313*495

This was probably the most complex and difficult puzzle of the event, and I don't think it was solved. Basically, it includes a file with the first 500 primes numbers, but with 7 anomalous additions. The line numbers corresponding with these non-prime additions are the keys to the puzzle.

In order to solve it, one would have to write a script to find the line numbers of all the anomalies and multiply them together to get the flag.
