# INVISIBLE INK MESSAGE

SOLUTION: `corgi`

This was one of tthe first puzzles that participants were intended to find. It involved a riddle/clues written on a piece of paper found by participants. This riddle pointed to Hugo Hu, who gave the participants a UV light along with his flag after the riddle was solved. The UV light revealed Ced's phone number in invisible ink on the paper - see `6-phonecall`.
