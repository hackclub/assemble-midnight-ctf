SOLUTION: `89685905732105809`

This puzzle was the most complex physical puzzle, involving a real rubiks cube (TODO PHOTO if we can find the cube). A scrambled rubiks cube discovered by participants had a number written on each face (9 per side). In order to solve this puzzle, one must first solve the rubiks cube, then follow the arrow on the 2d map of the cube contained in the image on the drive. The cube root of this sequence of numbers is the flag. Given the complexity of this puzzle, clues were contained in other puzzles.
