# Final Puzzle (Horcrux)

SOLUTION: `a::cc989e73fcc2f0724e35fc71305d86b7`
SECONDARY HORCRUX FLAG: `49e54eefa67eeeae7ebbe6919727223b`

To solve this puzzle, one would first have to bind the horcruxes from each of the other drives (https://github.com/jesseduffield/horcrux). This would unlock a secondary flag, as well as a wordlist containing the passcode (`mountain_0000`) to `key.zip`, which contains the flag.
